Testing is easy. I've set up a button in the main menu just for testing the effects of a key item.

Do edit it to suit your purposes, go to: "...\CoC_Game\Scenes\0 - Main_Menu\"

Open the "000.as" file and go all the way down to the bottom.

Now I've set up lines of code where you can change the stats of the player if your item has use variations depending on stats.

The other two things oyu need to change are these lines:
[...]
    _GAME_Characters[_GAME_ActiveCharacterID].inventory[1].AddItem(_GAME_Items[2], 1); // Add desired item to desired inventory.
[...]
_GAME_Items[2].Use(_GAME_Characters[_GAME_ActiveCharacterID]); // Use the item and see effect.

For the first line, all you need to change is the number in "_GAME_Items[2]" near the end. The number you need to change it to is the number of the key item you've made and added. To find this out, go to "...\CoC_Game\Items\" and open the "ItemList.as" file. See which item number your item is (E.g "// Item 4"). Now go back and change the number in "_GAME_Items[2]".

For the second line, it's the number "in _GAME_Items[2]" at the beginning that needs to have the number changed.
